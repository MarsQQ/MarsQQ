Hello! I'm Mars! 

You might know me under several other pen names. I am someone who likes to work on technology-centric stuff in my free-time and I love to learn by doing. You might know me from some of my various project like Coco Z, Comet, and Aimmy.

I wouldn't say I'm great at what I do, but I always try my best!
